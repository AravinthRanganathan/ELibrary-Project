						   It can equally be used for self-study. We take a top-down approach, addressing the

						   approaches in the form of abstract models, algorithms and detailed case studies of
						   widely used systems. We cover the field in sufficient depth and breadth to enable 
						   readers to go on to study most research papers in the literature on distributed systems.
